**Project: Customers and Products Analysis - Scale Model Cars Company**  

The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making.  

The scale model cars database contains eight tables as follows.
- Customers: customer data
- Employees: all employee information
- Offices: sales office information
- Orders: customers' sales orders
- OrderDetails: sales order line for each sales order
- Payments: customers' payment records
- Products: a list of scale model cars
- ProductLines: a list of product line categories

Below are the insights we want to explore in this project. 
1. Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
2. Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
3. Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
