**Project: Customers and Products Analysis - Scale Model Cars Company**  

The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making.  

The scale model cars database contains eight tables as follows.
- Customers: customer data
- Employees: all employee information
- Offices: sales office information
- Orders: customers' sales orders
- OrderDetails: sales order line for each sales order
- Payments: customers' payment records
- Products: a list of scale model cars
- ProductLines: a list of product line categories

Below are the insights we explored in this project.  

**1. Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?**   

Vintage cars and motorcycles are the priority for restocking in the top 10 Low-Stock Items. They have low stock, and they are the highest-performance products. 

**2. Question 2: How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?**  

- For the top 5 VIP customers, to maintain a good relationship with them, we can cater to them individually, perhaps with special events.
- For the top 5 less engaging customers, to bring them back more frequently, we can offer some incentive programs or increase customer interaction via email, calls, and direct customer support.

**3. Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?**  

We know that each customer brings us Â£39.039 (net profit). To determine how much to spend for acquiring a new customer, it also depends on the costs of sales and marketing. However, we can see the potential of each customer's profit so we can make a business plan for getting new more customers every quarter/year/month.
